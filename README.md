# Markov_Rap_Generator
Ted Xiao, 2015


## What is it?
Markov_Rap_Generator generates, well, rap songs. It uses a Markov Chain that you can extend by adding lyrics. A sample seeded Markov Chain has been included.

## How do I generate a rap song?
Simply run `MarkovRap.py` and follow the command line prompts. If you want to add more lyrics of your own, simply add them to the bottom of allLyrics.txt

## Does it work well?
The Markov Chain built on word frequencies alone does not work too well, as it does not consider grammar or semantics. However, it occasionally will generate vaguely real-sounding lyrics!

## This is useless. Why did you make this?
I was bored :)
