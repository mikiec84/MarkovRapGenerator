# Markov_Rap_Generator

##What is it?
Markov_Rap_Generator generates, well, rap songs using a Markov Chain that YOU can construct! A sample seeded Markov Chain has been included.

##How do I generate a rap?
Simply run MarkovRap.py and follow the command line prompts. If you want to add more lyrics of your own, simply add them to the bottom of allLyrics.txt

##This is useless. Why did you make this?
I was bored.
